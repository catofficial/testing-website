    some notes 

    remember to put the "<p>" and "</p>" for the paragraphs

    images can only be from wikipedia, i might as well make a wiki     page just so i can upload like 70 images lol

    if anyone is reading this, go ahead and spin-off if you want,      though i doubt anyone would want to spin off this somewhat         badly oganized code lol

    i might make this an actual website, since it's HTML, ill move     it to a github website

    thats it, thanks for reading my website or messy code
